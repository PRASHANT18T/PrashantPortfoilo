## 🚧 Development Process

### 1. **Planning**
- Wireframe created using Figma.
- Focused on minimal UI with animated impact.

### 2. **Development**
- Used React functional components with Tailwind.
- Added scroll animations using Framer Motion and GSAP.
- Made reusable card and section components.

### 3. **Challenges Faced**

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Image import error (`img: '{img1}'`) | Removed quotes to use `img: img1` properly |
| SplitText not animating | Fixed by setting `splitType="words"` and using correct delay |
| Responsive layout breaking | Used `flex-wrap`, `min-h-screen`, and Tailwind’s responsive breakpoints |
